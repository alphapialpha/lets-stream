# lets-stream
Easy to setup dockerized Nginx / RTMP Server with multi-user authentication as an ingest for your e.g. IRL streams or any other RTMP streams. The system furthermore provides outgoing RTMP streams for any incoming stream also protected by (optional) authentication for easy integration into e.g. your OBS. Can also push to services like Twitch or YT.
